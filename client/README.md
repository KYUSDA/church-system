# Getting Started with React + Vite

This project was bootstrapped with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `pnpm dev`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes thanks to Vite's fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR).\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `pnpm build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `pnpm preview`

Locally preview the production build.\
This serves the `dist` folder at [http://localhost:4173](http://localhost:4173) so you can test the production build before deploying.

### `pnpm lint`

Runs ESLint to check for code quality issues.\
You can add the `--fix` flag to automatically fix issues where possible.
